The python notebook in this repository is used to classify various images 
to determine if they are considered to be an image of a synapse or not. 
Ultimately, this algorithm used a random forest decision tree to classify 
these images.  By defining various characteristics of the images and using
these features as inputs to the random forest classifer, my approach reached 
92% accuracy in classifying these images.
